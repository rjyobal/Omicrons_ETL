### Comments and Findings

 Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental and health issues across OECD countries and beyond.
 Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can be inhaled and cause serious health problems including both respiratory 
 and cardiovascular disease, having its most severe effects on children and elderly people. Exposure to PM2.5 
 has been shown to considerably increase the risk of heart disease and stroke in particular. Cost estimates 
 represent only the cost of premature mortalities. They are calculated using estimates of the “Value of a Statistical Life” 
 (VSL) and the number of premature deaths attributable to ambient particulate matter.
